# Guessing-number-in-java
This is a small java code that initially generates a random number from 1 to 100 and then asks user to guess that number.                                           

Hello Everyone, Khilan Patel this side is now ready with a mini java program in which:                                                                               
i)   A random number is generated from 1 to 100 initially.                                                                                                           
ii)  User is asked to guess the number.                                                                                                                             
iii) Number entered is compared with generted random number:                                                                                                         
      a) if both are same number, prints "Correct Guess"                                                                                                             
      b) if guessed number is larger, prints "larger"                                                                                                               
      c) vice - versa for bigger.                                                                                                                                   
iv)  If user want to discontinue the process in between then can press any negative number.
